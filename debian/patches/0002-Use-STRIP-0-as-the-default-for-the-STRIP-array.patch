Subject: Use STRIP[0] as the default for the STRIP array.

If STRIP[0]='no' is set for the first module in a dkms.conf file,
then all other modules are usually built the same way. Producing
stripped and unstripped modules in the same build is rarely useful.

Thus, if STRIP[0] is explicitly set, then use it as the default
value for all other unset entries in the STRIP array.

 By default strip is considered to be "yes".  If set to "no", DKMS will not
 run strip \-g against your built module to remove debug symbols from it.
+STRIP[0] is used as the default for any unset entries in the STRIP array.
